    "text": "It was during my undergrad that I fostered my interests in biology, as well as data science. I was part of several research labs, in which I learned how to use data science methods to analyze public health data, specifically in Latin American countries. The last project I worked on had to do with analyzing covid prevalence in Mexico and examining whether socioeconomic variables had any impact on mortality.\nEven though I enjoyed the working with public health databases and analyzing that data, my interests have shifted recently to the analysis of biological data.\nOn my free time, I enjoy watching movies, traveling, listening to music, and taking pictures! My favorite movie to come out in this last year is the movie Drive My Car by Ryusuke Hamaguchi, based on Haruki Murakami’s short story of the same name. A song I have recently enjoyed is DESPECHÁ by Rosalía.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive My Car\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDESPECHÁ\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of my recent travels have taken me to the Arizona Desert, Joshua Tree and Egypt.\n\n\n\nArizona Desert\n\n\n\n\n\nJoshua Tree, CA\n\n\n\n\n\nGiza, Egypt"

We can also see that there are some differences in the sets included in each list. A couple that I would like to point out that we will come back to later are the Harry Potter sets, only included in the list with the most number of pieces and the LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO set, also only included in the the list with the most number of pieces.\nWe will analyse how some of these numbers have changed over the years. On the graphs below, we see that the both the average number of pieces per set, as well as the total number of sets produced have increased in the last 25 years. The package ggplot2 was used for these visualizations (Wickham, Chang, and Wickham 2016).\n\nwith_theme %>% filter(year >= 1997, num_parts > 10) %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(avg = mean(num_parts)) %>% ggplot(aes(year, avg)) + geom_line() + labs(x='Year', y='Average Number of Pieces', title='Average Number of Pieces in Last 25 Years', subtitle=\"Average number of pieces has increased in the last 25 years.\")\n\n\n\n\n\nwith_theme %>% filter(year >= 1997, num_parts > 10) %>% group_by(year) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% ggplot(aes(year, n)) + geom_line() + labs(x='Year', y='Number of Sets', title='Number of Sets in Last 25 Years', subtitle=\"Number of sets has increased in the last 25 years.\")\n\n\n\n\nUsing the list of themes that have the most number of pieces, now we will analyze how the number of pieces has changed over the years for each theme. We will also look at how the number of total sets produced per theme has varied. We will focus on the last 25 years only.\n\ntop <- with_theme %>% filter(theme_name %in% most_popular_pieces) %>% select(set_num, year, num_parts, theme_name) %>% filter(num_parts > 10) %>% group_by(theme_name, year) %>% summarize(sum = sum(num_parts), n=n()) %>% filter(year >= 1997) %>% ungroup()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'theme_name'.

In graph 1, We see in general that the total number of pieces per year has increased per theme. In graph 2, we see that some themes have largely increased the number of sets made, we see this for “Friends”, “City”, “Star Wars”, “Ninjago” and “Harry Potter”. On the other hand, “LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO” has increased, but the number of sets produced per year is still very low. This is in contrast to its number of pieces, which seems to have increased to upwards of 10000 by 2021.\nIn the plot below, we examine the distribution of the total number of sets produced per theme. We see that these themes all have varying distributions. The mean number of sets produced per theme ranges from 1 to upwards of 40. The “Friends” theme has the highest average number of sets made and it was also in the top for the most number of total pieces.\n\ntop_no_zero %>% ggplot(aes(theme_name, n)) + coord_flip() + geom_boxplot() + labs(x='Number of Sets', y='Theme Name', title='Distribution of number of Lego sets per theme', subtitle=\"Distributions of Lego sets vary widely by theme. Some have an average \\nnumber of sets upwards of 40, while the majority has an average number \\nof sets below 15.\")\n\n\n\n\nWe will now focus on three specific themes, the “Friends” theme, which has a large number of sets produced, as well as pieces, along with “Harry Potter”, a very iconic theme, which was in the list for highest number of pieces, but not for highest number of sets produced, and on “LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO” which was also in the list for highest number of pieces, but lagged behind on the number of sets produced.\nFirst, we look at the number of sets produced every year for those three themes. We see that “Friends” is the highest, even though it only started in 2012. “Harry Potter” did not make any sets from 2012-2017. This is probably because the last entry in the movie franchise premiered in 2011 and the Lego sets only got revitalized for the 20th anniversary of the first book coming out. “LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO” has been slowly increasing since it started in 2011.\n\nharry_potter <- with_theme %>% filter(theme_name == 'Harry Potter', num_parts > 10)\nlego_ideas <- with_theme %>% filter(theme_name == 'LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO', num_parts > 10)\nfriends <- with_theme %>% filter(theme_name == 'Friends', num_parts > 10)\n\n\nsets_of_interest <- rbind(harry_potter, lego_ideas, friends)\nsets_of_interest %>% ggplot(aes(x=year, fill=theme_name)) + geom_bar() + labs(x='Year', y='Number of Sets', title='Number of Sets for Select Themes in the Last 25 Years', subtitle=\"Friends has the highest number of sets produced per year. Harry Potter was the first theme to \\nstart in 2001, but had a dry spell in the late 2000's.\") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Theme Name\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nfriends_mean <- round(mean(friends$num_parts))\nfriends_max <- max(friends$num_parts)\nfriends_min <- min(friends$num_parts)\nharry_mean <- round(mean(harry_potter$num_parts))\nharry_min <- min(harry_potter$num_parts)\nharry_max <- max(harry_potter$num_parts)\nlego_mean <- round(mean(lego_ideas$num_parts))\nlego_max <- max(lego_ideas$num_parts)\nlego_min <- min(lego_ideas$num_parts)\n\nIn the graphs below, we see the distribution for the number of pieces for the three themes we had chosen. We see that “Friends” has the lowest distribution, followed by “Harry Potter”, which also has some outliers, and finally, “LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO”, with the highest distribution.\n\nknitr::kable(tibble('theme'=c('LEGO Ideas', 'Harry Potter', 'Friends'), 'min'=c(lego_min, harry_min, friends_min), 'max'=c(lego_max, harry_max, friends_max), 'avg'=c(lego_mean, harry_mean, friends_mean)))\n\n\n\n\n\ntheme\nmin\nmax\navg\n\n\n\n\nLEGO Ideas\n154\n3955\n1151\n\n\nHarry Potter\n16\n6020\n529\n\n\nFriends\n11\n1682\n207\n\n\n\n\n\nwith_theme %>% filter(num_parts > 10, theme_name %in% c('Friends', 'Harry Potter', 'LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO')) %>% ggplot(aes(x=theme_name, y=num_parts)) + coord_flip() + geom_boxplot() + labs(x='Number of Parts per Set', y='Theme Name', title='Distribution of Number of Parts per Set for Select Themes', subtitle=\"Friends has most narrow distribution, followed by Harry Potter. Harry Potter \\nhas very large outliers.\")\n\n\n\n\nWe can also see from the table below that the min for “LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO” is magnitudes higher than the other mins. The average for “LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO” is also higher than the others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe max is the highest for “Harry Potter”, with a whopping 6020 pieces per set and a retail price of $469.99.\n\n\n\ntop_legos_harry <- with_theme %>% filter(theme_name %in% c('Harry Potter')) %>% arrange(-num_parts) %>% head(3) %>% select(c('name', 'num_parts'))\nknitr::kable(top_legos_harry)\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nnum_parts\n\n\n\n\nHogwarts Castle\n6020\n\n\nDiagon Alley\n5548\n\n\nHogwarts Express - Collectors’ Edition\n5150\n\n\n\n\n\ntop_legos_ideas <- with_theme %>% filter(theme_name %in% c('LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO')) %>% arrange(-num_parts) %>% head(3) %>% select(c('name', 'num_parts'))\nknitr::kable(top_legos_ideas)\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nnum_parts\n\n\n\n\nHome Alone\n3955\n\n\nGrand Piano\n3662\n\n\nTree House\n3037\n\n\n\n\n\ntop_legos_friends <- with_theme %>% filter(theme_name %in% c('Friends')) %>% arrange(-num_parts) %>% head(3) %>% select(c('name', 'num_parts'))\nknitr::kable(top_legos_friends)\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nnum_parts\n\n\n\n\nMain Street Building\n1682\n\n\nHeartlake Grand Hotel\n1572\n\n\nHeartlake City Grand Hotel\n1309\n\n\n\n\nFrom the analysis of this LEGO dataset, we can get a sense of how Lego chooses what sizes the sets for each theme get. The them “LEGO Ideas and CUUSOO” is a theme made up mostly of collectible sets, sets which are for decoration and not really used to play with. This theme is marketed as being for “experienced users” or adults. The sets with the most number of pieces for this theme are a replica of the Home Alone house, a replica of a grand piano, and a tree house. These are all collectible, with only a small number of minifigures or no minifigures at all.\nThe same can be said for “Harry Potter”, as their sets with the most number of pieces are collectibles. They are the Hogwarts castle, Diagon Alley, and the Hogwarts Express, all very iconic landmarks of the movies. These are not playable sets, and are meant to be displays or collectibles. The difference is that “Harry Potter” also contains sets with small numbers of pieces, which can be used for playing.\nThe “Friends” theme is marketed for kids, specifically young girls.These sets are meant to be played with, which explains why so many sets are made and why that theme has so many pieces. This themes is also meant to fill a vacuum, as before, there really weren’t any Lego themes that were specifically targeted for young girls. If a girl wanted to play with Legos, she would have to choose a set that would typically be associated with boys like those of “City” which usually have firefighters, cops, astronauts, etc. This idea worked out for the company, as the theme has only been out for roughly 11 years, but it is in the top number of sets made and also total number of pieces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to keep in mind regarding the analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nIf there was data with the sales price for each set, we would be able to get a lot more information on how exactly it is that the Lego company chooses what sets are made and how big they are. There are many other factors that contribute to how many pieces each set has and how many sets are made per theme, such as minifigure inclusion, rarity of pieces, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagon Alley\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogwarts Castle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrand Piano\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHogwarts Express\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain Street Building\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeartlake Grand Hotel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nMock, Thomas. 2022. “Tidy Tuesday: A Weekly Data Project Aimed at the r Ecosystem.” https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday.\n\n\nShrestha, Nischal, Titus Barik, and Chris Parnin. 2021. “Remote, but Connected: How# TidyTuesday Provides an Online Community of Practice for Data Scientists.” Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction 5 (CSCW1): 1–31.\n\n\nWickham, Hadley, Winston Chang, and Maintainer Hadley Wickham. 2016. “Package ‘Ggplot2’.” Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics.
